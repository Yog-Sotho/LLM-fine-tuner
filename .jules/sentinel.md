## 2025-05-15 - [Credential Validation & XSS Prevention]
**Vulnerability:** Weak HuggingFace token validation in the Model Registry and incomplete HTML escaping in the evaluation preview.
**Learning:** Legacy components (`export/registry.py`) often lag behind more recently hardened ones (`export/hub.py`) in credential validation logic. Additionally, manual HTML escaping functions frequently miss the single quote (`'`), which is essential for preventing XSS in attribute-based injection scenarios.
**Prevention:** Centralize sensitive credential format constants (like `HF_TOKEN_PREFIX`) to ensure uniform validation across all entry points. Always include `&#x27;` in custom HTML escaping helpers, following OWASP standards.
